<h2>Espionage</h2>
<p>While there are some spy planes in use within the military, some are owned and operated by the CIA. Though not currently in their possesion my personal favorite of these planes is the Cold War era, supersonic A-12 Archangel. This impressive aircraft was a single seat, high altitute intelligene aircraft powered by twin J58 engines. This planes was also prototyped in other varients including the YF-12, the interceptor model, and was ultimetly the inspiration for the SR-71 Blackbird.</p>
